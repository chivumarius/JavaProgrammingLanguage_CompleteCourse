		Exercise 3 - Decorator Design Pattern







  • A car sales agency displays its sales prices as follows:

    Car		Without Options	 Option AC	Option ABS	Option AirBag
Nissan Sunny 	15000		 +1250		+900		+950
Honda Civic	18000		 +1500		+1000		+1150	







  • If we want to buy a Nissan Sunny car with ABS and Airbag, we will have to pay 15000 + 900 + 950 $.


  • A possible implementation of cars with options will be as follows:


  • So on, so 5 classes for each car to represent the different combinations of options.


  a) What design pattern can we improve on this design?
	•► Use "Decorator" Design Pattern.

  b) Give the class diagram of a new design based
on the chosen pattern.


  c) Develop in Java the implementation of this class diagram; take the case of a single car NissanSunny and only one option With air conditioning.
