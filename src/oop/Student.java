                   • "OOP" •
                  ► "CLASS" ◄



    ▬ "Java"
        → is an "Object-Oriented Programming" Language.



    ▬ "Everything" in "Java"
        → is "Associated" with "Classes" and "Objects",
        → along with its "Attributes" and "Methods".

        ♦ For Example:

            • A "Car"
                → is an "Object".


            • The "Car" has

                ► "Attributes", such as:
                     • Weight and
                     • Color, and
                ► Methods, such as:
                     • Drive and
                     → Brake.



    ▬ A "Class"
        → is like an "Object Constructor",
        → or a "Blueprint"
        → for "Creating Objects".



    ▬ A "Method"
        → is a "Block" of "Code"
        → which "Only Runs"
        → when it is "Called".


    ▬ We can "Pass Data",
        → Known as "Parameters",
        → into a "Method".



    ▬ "Methods"
        → are Used to "Perform" certain "Actions",
        → and they are also "Known"
        → as "Functions".


    ▬ We "Use Methods"
        → to "Reuse Code":
        → "Define" the "Code Once",
        → and "Use It Many Times".





                       ► "CONSTRUCTOR" ◄



    ▬ A "Constructor"
        → is a "Special Method"
        → that is "Used"
        → to "Initialize Objects".



    ▬ The "Constructor"
        → is "Called"
        → when an "Object" of a "Class"
        → is "Created".



    ▬ The "Constructor"
        → can be "Used"
        → to "Set Initial Values" ("Default")
        → for "Object Attributes".



    ▬ "All Java Classes"
        → have an "Empty Constructor"
        → by "Default".



    ▬ The "Constructor"
        → has "No Data Type Returned"
        → and has the "Sane Name"
        → as "Its Class".

    ▬ To "Create Objects"
        → we "Need" the "Constructor"
        → the "Empty Constructor" ("Default")
        → or the "Full State Constructor".
