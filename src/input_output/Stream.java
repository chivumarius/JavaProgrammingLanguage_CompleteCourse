                • "STREAM DATA" •



    ■ A "Stream"
        →  means a "Continuous Stream"
        → of "Data".


    ■ "Streams"
        → are a "Clean Way"
        → to "Process Input/Output"
        → "Without Every Part" of the "Code"
        → to "Understand" the "Physical Layer".


        ○ "Reading Data" from "Source":

                             "Input Stream"
               "Source"  --------------------------→  "Program"



        ○ "Writing Data" to "Destination":

                               "Output Stream"
               "Program"  --------------------------→  "Destination"



    ■ A "Stream"
        → is "Linked"
        → to a "Physical Layer"
        → by the "Java I/O" System
        → to "Make"
        → "Input"/"Output".



    ■ "Java"
        → "Encapsulates Streams"
        → under the "java.io" Package.



     ■ Java defines two types of streams:
        1- Byte Streams
        2- Character Streams.




    ■ "Stream" based "I/O"
        →  is "Built"
        → upon "Four Abstract Classes":
            1- "InputStream"
            2- "OutputStream"
            3- "Reader"
            4- "Writer"

    ■ "InputStream" and "OutputStream" Classes
        → are "Designed"
        → for "Byte Streams".



    ■ "Reader" and "Writer" Classes
        → are "Designed"
        → for "Character Streams".
