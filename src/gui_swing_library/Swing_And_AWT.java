             • "GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE" •
                  • "SWING" LIBRARY •
                        &
                    • "AWT" •
            • ("ABSTRACT WINDOWS TOOLKIT") •




    ▬ Java "AWT" ("Abstract Window Toolkit")
        → is an "API"
        → to Develop "Graphical User Interface" (GUI)
        → or "Windows-Based Applications"
        → in "Java".



    ▬ Java "AWT"
        → "Calls" the "Native Platform Subroutine" ("Operating Systems")
        →  for creating "API Components" like:
            • "TextField",
            • "CheckBox",
            • "button", etc.


    ▬ For "Example":
        → an "AWT GUI" with "Components" like:
            • "TextField",
            • "label" and
            • "button"
        → will have "Different Look" and "Feel"
        → for the "Different Platforms" like:
            • "Windows",
            • "MAC OS", and
            • "Unix".

        ♦ The "Reason" for "This"
            → is the "Platforms"
            → that have "Different View"
            → for their "Native Components"
            → and "AWT" directly "Calls" the "Native Subroutine"
            → that "Creates" those "Components".



    ▬ An "AWT Application"
        → will "Look" like a "Windows Application"
        → in "Windows OS"
        → whereas "It" will "Look" like a "Mac Application"
        → in the "MAC OS".



    ▬ "Swing"
        → is a "Java Foundation Classes" ("JFC") Library
        → and an "Extension"
        → of the "AWT" ("Abstract Window Toolkit").


    ▬ "Swing" Offers:
        • "Much-Improved Functionality" over "AWT",
        •  "New Components",
        •  Expanded "Components Features", and
        •  Excellent "Event Handling"
            → with "Drag-And-Drop Support".



    ▬ "Swing Features":

        1- "Swing"
            → is a "Set" Of "API"
            → ( "API" → "Set" Of "Classes" and "Interfaces" )


        2- "Swing"
            → is "Provided"
            → to "Design Graphical User Interfaces"


        3- "Swing"
            → is an "Extension Library"
            → to the "AWT" ("Abstract Window Toolkit")


        4- "Swing" Includes
            → "New" and "Improved Components"
            → that have been "Enhancing"
            → the "Looks" and "Functionality"
            → of "GUIs".


        5- "Swing"
            → can be "Used"
            → to "Build" ("Develop")
            → the "Standalone swing GUI Apps"
            → also as "Servlets"
            → and "Applets".


        6- It Employs
            → "Model/View Design Architecture"


        7- "Swing"
            → is more "Portable"
            → and more "Flexible"
            → than "AWT",

            • The "Swing" is "Built"
                → on "Top" of the "AWT".


        8- "Swing"
            → is "Entirely Written"
            → in "Java".


        9- "Swing Components"
            → are "Platform-Independent"
            → and the "Swing Components"
            → are "Lightweight".


        10- "Swing Supports"
            → a "Pluggable Look" and "Feels".


        11- "Swing"
            → "Provides" more "Powerful Components" such as:
                • "Tables",
                • "Lists",
                • "Scroll Panes",
                • "Colour Chooser",
                • "Tabbed Pane", etc


        12- "Swing"
            → Follows "MVC".
