	BRIDGE




  ▬ Bridge lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies: abstraction and implementation which can be developed independently of each other. 


  ▬ Abstraction? Implementation? 

  ▬ When talking about real applications, the abstraction can be represented by a graphical user interface (GUI), and the implementation could be the underlying operating system code (API) which the GUI layer calls in response to user interactions. 





Structure 

  1. The Abstraction provides high-level control logic. 

    ▬ It relies on the implementation object to do the actual low-level work. 


  2. The Implementation declares the interface that's common for all concrete implementations. 

    ▬ An abstraction can only communicate with an implementation object via methods that are declared here. 

    ▬ The abstraction may list the same methods as the implementation, but usually the abstraction declares some complex behaviors that rely on a wide variety of primitive operations.



  3. Concrete Implementations contain platform-specific code. 


  4. Refined Abstractions provide variants of control logic. 

    ▬ Like their parent, they work with different implementations via the general implementation interface. 


  5. Usually, the Client is only interested in working with the abstraction. However, it's the client's job to link the abstraction.
