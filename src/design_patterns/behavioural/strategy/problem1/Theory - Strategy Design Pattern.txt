		Theory - Strategy Design Pattern






  • Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.






○ Real World Example

  • Imagine that you have to get to the airport. You can catch a bus, order a cab, or get on your bicycle. These are your transportation strategies.






○ Structure

  1- The Context maintains a reference to one of the concrete strategies and communicates with this object only via the strategy interface.


  2- The Strategy interface is common to all concrete strategies. It declares a method the context uses to execute a strategy. 3- Concrete Strategies implement different variations of an algorithm the context uses.


  4- The Client creates a specific strategy object and passes it to the context. The context exposes a setter which lets clients replace the strategy associated with the context at runtime.

     • The context calls the execution method on the linked strategy object each time it needs to run the algorithm. The context doesn't know what type of strategy it works with or how the algorithm is executed.
